This is a (very) quick implementation of bezier curves. I had a project at school
in which we had the possibility to use bezier curves but I did not have the
time to do it. I was just curious to see how it is working.

->  details of implementation (bezier.py):

A function bezier_call() calls a recursive function that follows the recursive
definition of bezier curves. We fill an array of points trought a loop. The number
of execution of the instructions inside the loop depends on the t variable that
represents how often the points are calculated (its just a step). Finally, the 
computed points plot thanks to matplotlib.

  -Python3
  -matplotlib
  -tkinter
